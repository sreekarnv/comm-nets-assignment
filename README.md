# Double Square Cipher

During the encryption process, all white space, punctuation, special characters, and numerals will be erased from the plaintext.

Non-letter characters will be disregarded and deleted from the message. The whitespace numbers and punctuation will not be restored when the ciphertext is subsequently decoded.

### Rules For Keys Used

    1. Upto 25 characters in length
    2. Each letter may only be used once
    3. No white space punctuation numeric or special characters are allowed.
